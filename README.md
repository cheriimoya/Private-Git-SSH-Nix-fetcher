# Fetch private Git repos with ssh keys using Nix

This repo allows you to use a provided ssh key to fetch a private git repository.
It is very very rudimentary and specifically designed for my use case, i.e., fetching a repos contents without any fancy features.

## Usage

See the examples directory for basic usage.
